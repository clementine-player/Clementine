Opening an issue
----------------
### Ask for a new feature

Please:

 * Check if the new feature is not already implemented (Changelog)
 * Check if another person didn't already open an issue
 * If there is already an opened issue there is no need to comment "+1", it won't help. Instead, you can subscribe to the issue to be notified of anything new about it

### Report a bug

Please:
 
 * Try the latest build (https://github.com/clementine-player/Clementine/releases) to see if any bug is still present. If it works fine even though you see an open issue, please comment on it and explain that the issue has been fixed.
 * Check if another person has already opened the same issue to avoid duplicates
 * If there already is an open issue you could comment on it to add detail about the problem or confirm it
 * In case there isn't, you can open a new issue with an explicit title and as much information as possible (OS, Clementine version, how to reproduce the problem...)
 * Please use https://pastebin.com/ for logs/debug.
 
If there are no answers, it doesn't mean we don't care about your feature request/bug. It just means we can't reproduce the bug or haven't had time to implement it :o)
