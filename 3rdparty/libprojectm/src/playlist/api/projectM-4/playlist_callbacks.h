/**
 * @brief Callback function that is executed when the playlist wants to load a preset.
 *
 * This callback allows applications to handle preset loading themselves instead of
 * letting the playlist library load presets from the filesystem. This is useful for:
 * - Loading presets from archives (e.g., ZIP files)
 * - Loading presets from network sources (e.g., HTTP)
 * - Custom preset storage solutions
 *
 * When this callback is set and returns true, the playlist library will NOT attempt
 * to load the preset file itself and will return immediately without firing any events.
 * The application takes full responsibility for:
 * - Calling projectm_load_preset_file() or projectm_load_preset_data() with the preset content
 * - Handling any loading errors
 * - Firing the preset_switched_event callback when the preset is ready (if desired)
 *
 * Note: If implementing asynchronous loading, the application must complete the load and
 * fire the preset_switched_event callback itself after the async operation completes.
 *
 * If the callback returns false or is not set, the playlist library will use the
 * default behavior of loading the preset from the filesystem.
 *
 * @note The filename pointer is only valid inside the callback. Make a copy if it needs
 *       to be retained for later use.
 * @note Do not call any playlist preset-switching functions from within this callback.
 * @param index The playlist index of the preset to be loaded.
 * @param filename The preset filename/URL at this index. Can be used as a key or path.
 * @param hard_cut True if this should be a hard cut, false for a smooth transition.
 * @param user_data A user-defined data pointer that was provided when registering the callback,
 *                  e.g. context information.
 * @return True if the application handles preset loading, false to use default behavior.
 * @since 4.2.0
