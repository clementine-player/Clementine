 * @brief Loads and displays a new sprite.

 * <ul>
 * <li><tt>milkdrop</tt>: Original Milkdrop user sprite syntax. Pass the contents of an <tt>imgNN</tt> section in
 * the <tt>code</tt> argument.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Unsupported types and loading errors will result in failure, and no sprite will be added or replaced.
 *
 * @important The same OpenGL context used to create the projectM instance @a must be active when calling this method!
 * @param instance The projectM instance handle.
 * @param type The case-insensitive type name of the sprite to be displayed. See description for supported values.
 * @param code The type-specific sprite code, e.g. the contents of an <tt>imgNN</tt> section from a Milkdrop user
 *             sprite INI file.
 * @return A non-zero identifier if the sprite was successfully created, or zero if the type was
 *         unrecognized or the code couldn't be parsed.
