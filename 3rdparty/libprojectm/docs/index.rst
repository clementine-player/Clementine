projectM - The most advanced open-source music visualizer
---------------------------------------------------------

**Experience psychedelic and mesmerizing visuals by transforming music
into equations that render into a limitless array of user-contributed
visualizations.**

projectM is an open-source project that reimplements the esteemed
`Winamp Milkdrop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilkDrop>`__ by Geiss in
a more modern, cross-platform reusable library.

Its purpose in life is to read an audio input and to produce mesmerizing
visuals, detecting tempo, and rendering advanced equations into a
limitless array of user-contributed visualizations.

Important: This repository only contains libprojectM for use in application development!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This repository now only contains the projectM shared/static library.
All frontends, plug-ins and other tools were outsourced into separate
repositories. If you’re not a developer and just look for a download to
run projectM visuals on your machine or device, please use one of the
links listed below. The releases section in this repository only
contains source-code and binary releases of the projectM development
libraries and headers, which aren’t useful for end users.

Presets
~~~~~~~

The preset files define the visualizations via pixel shaders and
Milkdrop-style equations and parameters.

The projectM library does not ship with any presets. The frontends come
with varying preset packs which can be found in separate repositories in
the projectM repository list:

-  `Base Milkdrop texture
   pack <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-texture-pack>`__
   - Recommended for use with *any* preset pack!
-  `Cream of the Crop
   Pack <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-cream-of-the-crop>`__
   - A collection of about 10K presets compiled by Jason Fletcher.
   Currently, projectM’s default preset pack.
-  `Classic projectM
   Presets <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-projectm-classic>`__
   - A bit over 4K presets shipped with previous versions of projectM.
-  `Milkdrop 2
   Presets <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-milkdrop-original>`__
   - The original preset collection shipped with Milkdrop and Winamp.
-  `En D
   Presets <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/presets-en-d>`__ -
   About 50 presets created by “En D”.

Included with projectM are the bltc201, Milkdrop 1 and 2, projectM,
tryptonaut and yin collections. You can grab these presets
`here <http://spiegelmc.com/pub/projectm_presets.zip>`__.

You can also download an enormous 130k+ presets from the MegaPack
`here <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DlszoqMG-pc5v1Bo9x4NhemGPiwT-0pv/view>`__
(4.08GB zipped, incl. textures).

Building from source
--------------------

See :doc:`building` and the `developer documentation in the
wiki <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/wiki/Building-libprojectM>`__.

Using the library
-----------------

At its core projectM is a library, `libprojectM <src/libprojectM>`__.
This library is responsible for parsing presets, analyzing audio PCM
data with beat detection and FFT, applying the preset to the audio
feature data and rendering the resulting output with OpenGL. It can
render to a dedicated OpenGL context or a texture.

To get started using projectM in your own projects, please go to the
wiki and read the `developer
documentation <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/wiki#integrating-projectm-into-applications>`__
available there.

There are some open-source applications that make use of libprojectM
which can be found in the `projectM organization’s
repositories <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer>`__ and elsewhere.

Help
----

Report issues on GitHub in the respective repositories:

-  `Rendering issues, crashes or the libprojectM
   core/API <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/issues>`__
-  `Standalone SDL

-  Issues regarding the **projectM Android apps in the Play Store**,
   please contact the app author via the Play Store. We cannot help with
   any problems or requests.

If unsure, post your issue in the main `libprojectM issue
tracker <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm/issues>`__.
Please always check any existing issues if your problem has already been

Package Maintainers
-------------------

If you maintain packages of libprojectM, we are happy to work with you!
Please note well:

-  The main focus of this project is libprojectM. It’s a library that
   only really depends on OpenGL. The other applications are more like
   examples and demos.
-  Many of the frontend applications are likely outdated and of less
   utility than the core library. If you desire to use them or depend on
   them, please file an issue in the respective repository so we can
   help update them.
-  The “canonical” application for actually viewing the visualizations
   is now
   `projectMSDL <https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/frontend-sdl-cpp>`__,
   based on libSDL2 because it supports audio input and is completely
   cross-platform.
-  This is an open source project! If you don’t like something, feel
   free to contribute improvements!
-  Yes, you are looking at the official version. This is not a fork.
